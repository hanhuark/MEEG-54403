### Assignment 4 - Time Series Regression
The data file vapor_fraction.txt includes the vapor fraction (second column, dimensionless) vs. time (first column, unit: ms) of the boiling image sequences. The data are sampled with a frequency of 3,000 Hz (namely, a time step of 0.33 ms). Develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to forecast vapor fraction of future frames based on the past frames, e.g., predicting the vapor fraction profile of t = 33.33 ms – 66 ms using the vapor fraction history of t = 0.33 – 33 ms. Options include regular RNN, bidirectional RNN, gated recurrent unit (GRU), bidirectional GRU, long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM. (a) Develop a baseline model with an input sequence length of 16.33 ms (50 data points) and an output sequence length of 16.33 ms (50 data points). Plot the model-predicted signal vs. the true signal. (b) Vary the input and output sequence lengths to evaluate their effect on the error of the model predictions.
