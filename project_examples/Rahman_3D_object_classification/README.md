**Credits:** This project was completed by [Dr. Molla Hafizur Rahman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/molla-hafizur-rahman-ph-d-a5284151/) when taking the machine learning for mechanical engineers class in Fall 2021. The source code and report for this project can be found in Dr. Rahman's repo ["3D-CAD-model-classification"](https://github.com/HafizSunny/3D-CAD-model-classification)

**Abstract:** In recent years, deep learning has gained great success in image and object detection. With the increasing number of 3D CAD models, object detection with these 3D data is ubiquitous in different fields such as self-driving car, garments, architecture, etc. Similarly in the mechanical field, various research has been done for 3D mechanical shape classification and retrieval. Therefore, models are required that can efficiently detect different mechanical parts. Identifying and exploring the shape of mechanical components is vital for computer vision and manufacturing applications. Therefore, the objective of this project is to the identification of appropriate data representation and classification of 3D mechanical components. In this project, volumetric data and point clouds are selected to represent 3D data as these data types are popular and have great potential to further extend the deep learning models based on these data. Particularly, VoxNet based on volumetric data and PointNet based on point cloud data is developed. The models are evaluated with different metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accurarcy.
