### Assignment 3 - Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering
Run dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis of the same dataset used in HW-2. <br/>
(a) Run single value decomposition (SVD) or principal component analysis (PCA) of the images and plot the percentage explained variance vs. the number of principal components (PC). (b) Pick a representative image, run PCA and plot the reconstructed images using a different number of PCs (e.g. using PC1, PCs 1-2, PCs, 1-10, PCs 1-20, etc.). (c) Calculate the error of the reconstructed images relative to the original image and plot the error as a function of the number of PCs. (d) Run a clustering analysis of the boiling images using the PCs (the number of PCs to use is up to your choice) and evaluate the results of clustering.
