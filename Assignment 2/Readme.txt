Assignment 2 - Image Classification
Pool boiling is a heat transfer mechanism that dissipates a large amount of heat with minimal temperature increase by taking the advantage of the high latent heat of the working fluids. As such, boiling has been widely implemented in the thermal management of high-power-density systems, e.g., nuclear reactors, power electronics, and jet engines, among others. The critical heat flux (CHF) condition is a practical limit of pool boiling heat transfer. When CHF is triggered, the heater surface temperature ramps up rapidly (~ 150 C/min), leading to detrimental device failures. There is an increasing research interest in predicting CHF based on boiling images. Under the directory /ocean/projects/mch210006p/shared/HW1/classification, there are two folders, namely, “pre-CHF” and “post-CHF” that contain pool boiling images before and after CHF is triggered, respectively. The target of this problem is to develop a machine learning model to classify the boiling regime (pre or post CHF) based on boiling images. a. Split the data set into training, validation, and testing. This can be done before training with a separate package “split-folders” or directly in the code during training. b. Set up and train a model to classify the pre-CHF and post-CHF images. Report the training curves (training/validation accuracy/loss vs. epoch) and the training time (time/epoch, time till the best model). Use EarlyStopping for fast convergence. c. Test the model using the reserved test data, report the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC).
